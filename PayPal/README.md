# Some JavaScript coding questions that were asked as part of the Staff Software Engineer role at PayPal in the past:

## General

1. Given some positive integer n, write a method to return the fewest number of perfect square numbers which sum to n.
2. On a given street, there's a bunch of houses and lamps nearby. It looks kind of like the following (H being houses, L being lamps):
   SNIPPET
   L H L H H
   0 1 2 3 4
   We decide to represent this with two arrays: one being the positions of the houses, and the other the positions of the lamps. From the above example, the arrays would be:
   SNIPPET
   houses = [1, 3, 4]
   lamps = [0, 2]
   With this knowledge, can you find out the minimum radius that the lamps would need to cover in order for every house to get access to light?

## String

1. Given a string, reverse the string and print it.
2. Given a string, validate if its palindrome.
3. Given a string, find the longest substring that does not contain any repeated characters and print it.
4. Find a way to convert a string to a palindrome by inserting characters in front of it.
5. You're given a string of random alphanumerical characters with a length between 0 and 1000. Write a method to return the first character in the string that does not repeat itself later on.

## Array

1. Given an array of numbers, find the maximum number in the array and print it.
2. Write a code to find the number of rectangles on a chessboard.
3. Dutch national flag problem : Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the elements in linear time and constant space.

## Binary Tree

1. Given a binary tree, print the inorder traversal of the tree.
2. Given the binary tree, find its level order traversal.
3. Print the right view of a binary tree.

## Linked List

1. Given a linked list, reverse the linked list and print it.
2. Write a method getIntersection(list1, list2) to find the intersection of two linked lists?
3. Convert a Linked List to a binary search tree?

## Matrix

Print a given matrix in spiral form.
